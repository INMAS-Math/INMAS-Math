# What is INMAS?
INMAS is a network of universities, businesses, industries, and organizations with a desire toâ€¦

- increase career opportunities for graduate students in the fields of mathematics, statistics, and related disciplines;
- help (regional) organizations leverage young talents in local universities;
- increase collaborations between business, industry, and government (BIG) and academia through a robust network of organizations and institutions,

and with a passion for diversity, equity, and inclusion.

# Why INMAS?
Doctorate programs in many disciplines often do not provide role models beyond being research academicians, and many scientific graduate programs lack a practical view of the talent demand from the business, industry, and government sectors.

But most Ph.D. students end up working in the business, industry, and government sectors.

Therefore, the INMAS initiative was proposed to address this issue by providing additional professional training and an industrial internship program for graduate students.

# How does INMAS achieves its goals?
Along these three principal activities:
1) By providing direct resources to build and maintain a sustainable network of stakeholders from universities, businesses, industries, and government agencies;
2) By better preparing graduate students for the job market with training activities specific to key economic sectors and complementary to their core disciplinary training;
3) And by facilitating successful internship opportunities that will be beneficial to both the hosting organizations and graduate students.

# Why do students participate in the INMAS program?
This word cloud was formed from the essays that students write when applying to the INMAS program. Our acceptance rate is about 50%.
