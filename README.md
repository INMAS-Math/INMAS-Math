# What is INMAS?
INMAS is a network of universities, businesses, industries, and organizations with a desire toâ€¦

- increase career opportunities for graduate students in the fields of mathematics, statistics, and related disciplines
- help (regional) organizations leverage young talents in local universities
- increase collaborations between business, industry, and government (BIG) and academia through a robust network of organizations and institutions
- and with a passion for diversity, equity, and inclusion.

# Why INMAS?
- Doctorate programs in many disciplines often do not provide role models beyond being research academicians,
- And many scientific graduate programs lack a practical view of the talent demand from the business, industry, and government sectors.
- But most Ph.D. students end up working in the business, industry, and government sectors.
- Therefore, the INMAS initiative was proposed to address this issue by providing additional professional training and an industrial internship program for graduate students.

# How does INMAS achieves its goals?
- By providing direct resources to build and maintain a sustainable network of stakeholders from universities, businesses, industries, and government agencies;
- Better preparing graduate students for the job market with training activities specific to key economic sectors and complementary to their core disciplinary training;
- Facilitating successful internship opportunities that will be beneficial to both the hosting organizations and the graduate students.
